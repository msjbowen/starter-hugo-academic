### Suspended Judgment: A solution to the Probabilistic Liar
> In this paper I argue that the rational attitude to adopt towards the Probabilistic Liar is to suspend judgment. After presenting the problem that the Probabilistic Liar poses for traditional accounts of rationality I develop an account of how suspended judgment should be understood in a credal framework. I argue that a suspended judgment ought to be understood as having imprecise credences of a certain form. I show how this understanding fits with our intuitions about suspended judgment as serves as a solution to the Probabilistic Liar. 




### The Cognitive Role of Indeterminacy
> There are a variety of norms that purport to govern what attitude an agent ought to adopt. It is unclear, however, what attitude a rational agent ought to have towards an indeterminate proposition or whether there is a norm that prescribes an attitude. It is also unclear what falls under the term indeterminate and the range of phenomena that might be referred to as indeterminate. 
This paper address the normative question of what attitude a rational agent ought to adopt towards cases of indeterminacy. I defend the view that indeterminacy should be understood as an umbrella term that encompasses a range of related phenomena. In light of this I argue we should adopt a position I call modest pluralism to the normative question. Modest pluralism holds that there is no unique attitude an agent ought to adopt to cases of indeterminacy, but rather a range of permissible attitudes to adopt.
