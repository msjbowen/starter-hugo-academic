## Interests

When I'm not doing philosophy, I can be found rock climbing, running or hiking. 

## Music

I also play the cello and have performed with ensembles across the UK and Europe as well as solo performances (including recent forays into playing at friend's weddings!). 

I've taken part in two filming projects as a cellist: 

* Prélude (2020): A proof of concept piece for director, producer and film maker [[Rochyne Delaney McNulty’s] (<https://rochynedm.wixsite.com/portfolio>)] (successful!) funding bid with Bradford Arts Council. 

* Out of the Darkness (2013): Working with writer and director Emma Lucia Hands (https://emmalucia.co.uk/) on her short film funded by the Arts Council of Wales.
