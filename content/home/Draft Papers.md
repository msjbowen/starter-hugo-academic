## Suspended Judgment: A solution to the Probabilistic Liar
> In this paper I argue that the rational attitude to adopt towards the Probabilistic Liar is to suspend judgment. After presenting the problem that the Probabilistic Liar poses for traditional accounts of rationality I develop an account of how suspended judgment should be understood in a credal framework. I argue that a suspended judgment ought to be understood as having imprecise credences of a certain form. I show how this understanding fits with our intuitions about suspended judgment as serves as a solution to the Probabilistic Liar.
